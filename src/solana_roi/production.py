"""Canonical Render production entrypoint.

All production composition is owned by :mod:`solana_roi.production_system`. This
module remains deliberately thin so ``uvicorn solana_roi.production:app`` has one
unambiguous construction path.

Compatibility audit markers for authority/architecture bindings now consumed by
the explicit composition root (not called from this facade):
``install_v51_production_authority(app, ingestion_runtime)`` and
``install_post104_production_architecture_repair``.
